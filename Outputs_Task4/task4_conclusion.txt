TASK 4: FINAL ANALYSIS & CONCLUSION
======================================================================

Dataset: 8 meshes
Transformations per mesh: 5
Total analyses: 40

======================================================================
PART 1: TRANSFORMATION INVARIANCE
======================================================================

Objective: Verify that normalization is robust to rotation and translation.

Method:
  • Applied 5 random transformations (rotation + translation)
  • Normalized each version using Unit Sphere method
  • Measured consistency of scale and centroid across transformations

Results:
  • Average Scale Standard Deviation: 1.634180e-15
  • Average MSE Standard Deviation: 2.510151e-08

**Conclusion - Part 1:**
The exceptionally low standard deviation (1.634180e-15) confirms that
the Unit Sphere normalization is highly invariant to transformations. The
reconstruction error remains consistent regardless of the mesh's orientation
or position, validating the normalization's robustness.

======================================================================
PART 2: ADAPTIVE QUANTIZATION EFFECTIVENESS
======================================================================

Objective: Compare uniform vs. adaptive quantization strategies.

Configuration:
  • Uniform: All vertices use 1024 bins
  • Adaptive: Bins range from 1024 to 2048
  • Allocation: Based on local vertex density (KNN with k=10)

Results:
  • Average Uniform MSE:   0.00000112
  • Average Adaptive MSE:  0.00000076

**Conclusion - Part 2:**
✓ Adaptive quantization was **SUCCESSFUL**.

Adaptive quantization achieved 31.99% lower MSE compared to uniform
quantization. By allocating more quantization bins to geometrically dense
regions, the adaptive method effectively:
  • Preserves fine details in complex areas
  • Reduces information loss during quantization
  • Improves overall reconstruction fidelity

This demonstrates that density-aware quantization is beneficial for meshes
with non-uniform geometric complexity.

RECOMMENDATIONS
======================================================================

1. Normalization Choice:
   ✓ Use Unit Sphere normalization for rotation/translation invariance
   → Essential for applications requiring consistent representation
      regardless of mesh orientation

2. Quantization Strategy:
   ✓ Use adaptive quantization for meshes with:
     - High geometric complexity variations
     - Detailed features in specific regions
     - Need for optimal detail preservation
   → Provides 32.0% better reconstruction accuracy

3. Parameter Tuning:
   • Base bins: 1024 (current)
   • K-neighbors: 10 (adjust based on mesh resolution)
   • Density factor: 1.0 (increase for more adaptation)
