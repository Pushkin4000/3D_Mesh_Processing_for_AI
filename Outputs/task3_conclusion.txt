TASK 3: RECONSTRUCTION ERROR ANALYSIS - CONCLUSION
======================================================================

Summary Statistics:
  Min-Max Normalization:
    • Mean MSE: 0.00000039
    • Mean MAE: 0.00043621

  Unit Sphere Normalization:
    • Mean MSE: 0.00000111
    • Mean MAE: 0.00083986

Analysis:

  Min-Max normalization consistently resulted in lower reconstruction 
    errors (MSE ≈ 0.000000) compared to Unit Sphere normalization.

  • Min-Max achieves 64.9% lower MSE on average
  • This suggests axis-independent scaling better preserves geometric detail
    through quantization for this dataset

Per-Axis Error Analysis:
  • Y-axis showed slightly higher error (MSE: 0.00000047)
  • This may be due to scale compression during normalization or
    quantization bin distribution along this axis

Quantization Quality:
  • With 1024 bins, both methods preserve geometric detail well
  • Average reconstruction error is very low (< 0.001 for most meshes)
  • Minimal perceptual distortion expected in reconstructed meshes

Recommendation:
  • For this dataset, Min-Max normalization is recommended
  • Error levels are acceptable for most 3D processing applications
  • Consider using 2048 bins for even higher fidelity if needed
